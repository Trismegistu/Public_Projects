# Public_Projects

The following is some of the projects that I worked on with some of my friends during my Applied Machine Learning class. 

1. Predicting_Health:

The main objective of this project was to predict various health-related outcomes based on the symptoms of several
patients from two different labelled datasets; the Hepatitis dataset and the Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen dataset.

For this we found that decision trees performed better than KNN's.

2. Linear_Classification

The goal of this project was to apply different linear classification machine learning models and compare
their respective performance on two document classification benchmark datasets. The Naive Bayes
(NB) and Logistic Regression (LR) models were simulated on both datasets to obtain the optimal
models with maximal validation accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.

At the end of it we found Niave Bayes to both have a better test accuracy and a much faster training time.

3. MLP_Image_Classification

The goal of this project was to perform image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The goal was
to find how close we could get to a CNN-level test accuracy using only MLP's

We found that the optimal MLP architecture got aorund 88% test accuracy while a basic CNN got 92%.

4. Reproducing_LeNet

Here we tried to recreate some results of the famous paper on LeNet, published by Yann LeCun in 1998.

We also validated that the LeNet model is robust to overtraining. However,we obtained data contradicting 
the authorsâ€™ hypothesis regarding the causes of this robustness.
